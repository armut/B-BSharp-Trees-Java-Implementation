# B Tree and B# Tree Java Implementation

I tried to implement B Tree and B# Tree in Java. BSharpTree class inherits BTree class.
Everything is simple, stupid. Feel free to correct me when you find bugs(there are tons of them here!).

Deletion method is also in the todo list.

## Compiling/Running the Program

For a quick glance, you can cd into src/ folder and execute as usual:

```
$ javac Node.java BTree.java BSharpTree.java Main.java
$ java Main
```

That's all.
